This repo contains python scripts that have served a purpose in some sort of incident response effort. 

These scripts can be modified or build upon as they're written in a foundational and conceptional manner. 

Improvements include:

using import json module to further parse the jason output
changing the api endpoints from hybrid analysis to virustotal, etc.
